  # This is the key line.
  # Empty list disables ALL inbound failsafe pinholes (including 22 and 6443).
  failsafeInboundHostPorts: []

  # Optional but usually wise: leave outbound failsafes alone unless you know why.
  # If you want to be strict, you can also set failsafeOutboundHostPorts: []
  # but that can break node bootstrap / DNS / API access depending on your design.
